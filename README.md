##  Overview

The nationwide lockdown in Greece, implemented to flatten the COVID-19 curve, led to a **significant reduction in anthropogenic emissions**.  
This study investigates the **impact of the pandemic on atmospheric pollution levels**, using it as a **real-life "simulation"** of reduced human activity.

##  Study Periods

We focus on the **first nationwide lockdown**, during which traffic in central Athens dropped by **49.5%** compared to the same period in 2019.

We distinguish the following time periods:

1. **Pre-Lockdown**: March 1 – 22, 2020  
2. **Lockdown**: March 22 – May 4, 2020  
3. **Post-Lockdown**: May 4 – 31, 2020

##  Monitoring Stations

The following air quality stations were selected for analysis:

- **Patision**  
  -  Traffic reduction: −40.2%
- **Athinas**  
  -  Traffic reduction: −46.6% on Panepistimiou Ave.  
  -  Traffic reduction: −42.7% on Stadiou Ave.
- **Geoponiki** 

**Selection criteria:**

- High data availability during the study period
- Central Athens locations, significantly affected by traffic emissions
